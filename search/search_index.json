If the entire declaration, statement, or expression fits on one line, then do that. 2. Comma-delimited lists are only laid out in one direction: horizontally or vertically. In other words, all elements must fit on the same line, or each element must be on its own line. A horizontally-oriented list does not contain any line breaks, even before the first element or after the last element. Except in control flow statements, a vertically-oriented list contains a line break before the first element and after each element. 3. A continuation line starting with an unbreakable token sequence is indented at the same level as the original line. 4. A continuation line that is part of a vertically-oriented comma-delimited list is indented exactly +2 from the original line. 5. When an open curly brace (<code>{</code>) follows a line-wrapped declaration or expression, it is on the same line as the final continuation line unless that line is indented at +2 from the original line. In that case, the brace is placed on its own line, to avoid the continuation lines from blending visually with the body of the subsequent block.</p> <p>GOOD</p> <pre><code>public func index&lt;Elements: Collection, Element&gt;(\n  of element: Element,\n  in collection: Elements) -&gt; Elements.Index?\nwhere\n  Elements.Element == Element,\n  Element: Equatable\n{\n  for current in elements {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>AVOID</p> <pre><code>public func index&lt;Elements: Collection, Element&gt;(\n  of element: Element,\n  in collection: Elements) -&gt; Elements.Index?\nwhere\n  Elements.Element == Element,\n  Element: Equatable {\n  for current in elements {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For declarations that contain a <code>where</code> clause followed by generic constraints, additional rules apply: * If the generic constraint list exceeds the column limit when placed on the same line as the return type, then a line break is first inserted before the <code>where</code> keyword and the <code>where</code> keyword is indented at the same level as the original line. * If the generic constraint list still exceeds the column limit after inserting the line break above, then the constraint list is oriented vertically with a line break after the <code>where</code> keyword and a line break after the final constraint.</p> <p>Concrete examples of this are shown in the relevant subsections below.</p> <p>This line-wrapping style ensures that the different parts of a declaration are quickly and easily identifiable to the reader by using indentation and line breaks, while also preserving the same indentation level for those parts throughout the file.

For example: <pre><code>struct Document {\n  enum ReadError: Error {\n    case notFound\n    case permissionDenied\n    case malformedHeader\n  }\n\n  init(path: String) throws {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\ndo {\n  let document = try Document(path: \"important.data\")\n} catch Document.ReadError.notFound {\n  // ...\n} catch Document.ReadError.permissionDenied {\n  // ...\n} catch {\n  // ...\n}\n</code></pre> Such a design forces the caller to consciously acknowledge the failure case by: * wrapping the calling code in a <code>do-catch</code> block and handling error cases to whichever degree is appropriate, * declaring the function in which the call is made as <code>throws</code> and letting the error propagate out, or * using <code>try?</code> when the specific reason for failure is unimportant and only the information about whether the call failed is needed.</p> <p>In general, with exceptions noted below, force-try! is forbidden; it is equivalent to <code>try</code> followed by <code>fatalError</code> but without a meaningful message.

It is also allowed in non-test code when it is unmistakably clear that an error would only be thrown because of programmer error; we specifically define this to mean a single expression that could be evaluated without context in the Swift REPL. For example, consider initializing a regular expression from a a string literal: <pre><code>let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: \"a*b+c?\")\n</code></pre> The <code>NSRegularExpression</code> initializer throws an error if the regular expression is malformed, but when it is a string literal, the error would only occur if the programmer mistyped it.
